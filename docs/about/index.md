# Introduction

Hi! I’m Riya Rai, a PhD student in Physics at McGill University, Canada, where I’m diving deep into experimental particle physics. I completed my bachelors and masters (BS-MS) in Physics from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Bhopal, India. 

My research interest sits at the fascinating intersection of the tiny (like neutrinos) and the massive (like galaxies and gravitational waves). I’ve always been fascinated by the universe and how things work at both cosmic and subatomic levels, and that’s led me to work on projects ranging from machine learning in astronomy to cutting-edge particle detectors.
