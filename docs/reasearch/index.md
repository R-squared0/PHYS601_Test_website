# Research Interests

My doctoral research focusses on developing photodetection technologies using Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) by testing and characterising their performance in vacuum at very low temperatures. I am also working on the Light Only Liquid Xenon (LoLX) experiment, which focuses on how light signals behave in liquid xenon. My role involves developing new methods to calibrate
the LOLX experiment using various radioactive sources. This includes designing and implementing hardware for
an upgraded radioactive source and analyzing how light is detected and transported in liquid xenon. By
integrating theoretical models with experimental data, we want to enhance our understanding of how light
interacts in this unique environment, which is crucial for the success of experiments like nEXO.
