# Projects

My work as an undergrad and a grad student has spanned from the very experimental—building hardware and designing experiments—to the more theoretical and computational, where I’m trying to figure out the mysteries of the universe using data, physics, and a little bit of AI.
Here are some projects that I have previously worked on. 

## Ba-tagging for nEXO Upgrade

nEXO is a ton scale liquid Xenon experiment being built to understand the nature of neutrinos. Specifically, I worked on the Ba-tagging technique, which could be a potential upgrade for nEXO which would increase our sensitivity. 
In simple terms, Ba-ion tagging is like putting a spotlight on a neutrino’s footprint. When a neutrino interacts inside the nEXO detector, it leaves behind a barium ion, and our job is to help develop a technique to detect that ion. If we can spot it, we know a that a double beta decay occured at that site, which helping us improve nEXO's sensitivity. It’s a bit like trying to find a super faint signal in the middle of a noisy concert, but when you do, it’s incredibly exciting because neutrinos hold clues to some of the biggest questions in physics, like why there’s more matter than antimatter in the universe.

## Machine Learning in Astronomy

I built a model to predict the semimajor axis of orbits of exoplanets (planets outside our solar system). Traditionally, calculating these orbits using telescope observations takes years—but by applying machine learning, we can speed up that process significantly. [Rai, R., & Basu, T. (2023).

## Primordial Gravitational Waves for New Physics

My thesis was about how gravitational waves formed very early in the universe (primordial) might be linked to new physics that we haven’t even discovered yet. Gravitational waves are ripples in spacetime caused by some of the most energetic processes in the universe (like colliding black holes!). My project explored how these waves might also carry information about unknown particles or forces, especially those that could explain gaps in the Standard Model of physics. Basically, I studied how gravitational waves can help us discover new pieces of the puzzle that make up our universe.
