# Welcome to My Research Page

Welcome to my research page! My work focuses on developing experimental techniques to help study neutrinos. Despite the success of the Standard Model in explaining particle physics, it leaves many questions unanswered, particularly regarding the elusive neutrino. I am involved in the next-generation Enriched Xenon Observatory (nEXO) experiment, which aims to detect neutrinoless double beta decay and uncover the mysteries of these unique particles using liquid Xenon. My research includes the developement of light detection for nEXO through Silicon Photo Multiplier(SiPM) testing and the Light-only Liquid Xenon (LoLX) experiment, where I investigate scintillation light detection to improve the sensitivity of nEXO and future experiments.
